# Travel Game: CMSC389A

Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build the backend neural network for a scavenger hunt game to play when traveling. The software has a list of targets (different cars and signs) that it prompts the user for and then it processes the picture that the user gives it in return.

Team: 
Matthew Sinnott

How to run code / Rquirements:
All the code has been developed in python using Keras in a Jupyter notebook. Other Python libraries that you need to install are scipy, numpy, sklearn heapq, imageio, Pillow, tqdm, glob and cv2. A full list of imports is included at the beginning of the notebook. To run the code, simply run through the notebook. If the data that you downloaded doesn't match the filepaths, fix the defined filepaths in the code to match your directory structure.

Data:
There are three relevant datasets that I looked at for this project, but I only used two of them: the Stanford Car Dataset and the Belgian Sign Dataset. The German Sign Dataset is small and not very varied, so I decided to not use it.
